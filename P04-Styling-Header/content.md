# Styling the header
Currently, our header and navbar donâ€™t really look like a navbar at the moment. 
We need to add some styles to it.


>[action] Navigate to your project root folder and create a new folder named resources.
```bash
mkdir resources
```
This folder will hold your css, javascript and image files.

>[action] Inside your resources folder, create another folder named css. Here you will store your css files. 

```bash
cd resources
mkdir css
```

>[action] Open the css folder and create a file named styles.css. This is where all your element styles would go to.
```bash
cd css
touch styles.css
```
>[action] Now, open the styles.css file.

## Reference elements in a stylesheet
There are different ways on how to reference elements in a stylesheet. 

1. by the element tag name. 
1. by the class name. 
1. by id name

# Styling the body element
The body is the first thing we want to style.
Weâ€™re going to start by styling the **font family** and **font size**. 

**Line height** - to increase spacing between lines (1.5 - 1.6) is recommended
**Font family** - there are different font families. Here we will be using Helvetica font.
**Font size** - 16 px. 

>[action] Add the following line of code to your styles.css file
```css
body{
  font-family: Helvetica;
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.5;
  margin: 0;
}
```
>[action] Now refresh your browser.

Hmm, we were expecting to see some change but donâ€™t see any. ðŸ¤”

Can you guess why? 

>[solution] Thatâ€™s because we havenâ€™t linked our stylesheet in our HTML file.
We need to use ```<link>``` tag inside the ```<head>``` element to link our css file. 

>[action] inside the ```<head>``` element of your index.html, add the ```<link>``` element.

```html
<link rel='stylesheet' href='./resources/css/styles.css'>
```

>[action] Now go ahead and refresh your page.

Sweet! We see some font change!

We want our Webiste name to be on the left side and the navigation links (Home, about, cart) to be on the other side. For this, we will use **flexbox layout**.
 
**Enter example screenshot!!!!!!!!!**

# What is flexbox?

Flexbox helps to position elements inside a container. 
We set flex properties on the parent element (container) to make elements inside the container move. 

To learn more about flexbox : [Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp)

The flex container becomes flexible by setting the **display** property to flex.

```<Header>``` is our container so we will be setting the display property of header to flex. Inorder to refer to our header inside the css file we will be using itâ€™s class name. 


The class name for header is '**page-header**â€™. 
we use dot (.) before the name when referring to class names in css files.

For example **.page-header**
